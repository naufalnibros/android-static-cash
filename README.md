<p>
StaticCash is a sample Android project using <a href="https://naufalnibros.github.io/static-cash.json">StaticCash.json</a> API based on MVVM architecture. It is my test skill project at that time~
</p>

> *First of all, you need to understand Android Architecture Components, i'm follow Google recommended Guide to app architecture to structure architecture based on MVVM, reactive UI using LiveData / RxKotlin observables and view binding.*
>
> *Learning from: [Guide to app architecture
](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide)*


## Features
* 100% Kotlin
* MVVM architecture
